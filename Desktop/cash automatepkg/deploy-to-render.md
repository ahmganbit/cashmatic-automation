# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Fix Guide

## The Problem
Render is looking for: `/opt/render/project/src/src/package.json`
But your files are in: `/opt/render/project/src/package.json`

## Solution 1: Update Render Dashboard Settings (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your service: `cashmatic-automation`
3. Click **Settings**
4. Update these fields:

   **Root Directory**: ` ` (LEAVE COMPLETELY EMPTY - not "src", not ".", just empty)
   **Build Command**: `npm install`
   **Start Command**: `npm start`

5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Click **Manual Deploy** to trigger a new deployment

## Solution 2: If Dashboard Settings Don't Work

Delete the render.yaml file and use manual settings:

1. Delete or rename `render.yaml` to `render.yaml.backup`
2. Use only the dashboard settings above
3. Ensure your package.json is in the root directory (which it is)

## Solution 3: Alternative Structure (If needed)

If Render absolutely requires the src structure:

1. Move all files to a `src` subdirectory
2. Set Root Directory to: `src`
3. Keep Build/Start commands the same

## Current File Structure (CORRECT)
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json âœ… (This is what Render needs)
â”œâ”€â”€ server.js âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ render-server.js âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json âœ… (Backup)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.js âœ… (Backup)
â””â”€â”€ render.yaml âœ…
```

## Test After Deployment
Your site should be available at:
- https://cashmatic-automation.onrender.com
- https://cashmatic-automation.onrender.com/dashboard
- https://cashmatic-automation.onrender.com/api/status

## If Still Having Issues
1. Check Render build logs for exact error
2. Verify GitHub repo has latest changes
3. Try manual deploy from dashboard
4. Contact me with the exact error message
